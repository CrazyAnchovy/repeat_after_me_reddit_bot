# repeat_after_me_reddit_bot

This is the code for a reddit bot I made that reads the subreddit of your chosing, and if it finds a comment starting with 'repeat after me' it will repeat that comment.

I'm still learning, I'm just stoked that I wrote a program.

This is my attempt at learning to manage something from github.

Thanks for checking it out.
